      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Wolf Woods Design is a design agency focused on improving user experience by focusing on a human-centric approach and strong qualitative and quantitative justification. The team focused on improving and redesigning the 220 ml Heinz ketchup bottle, which is a widely used and recognized consumer product with high production volumes. By this, the design team aims to increase Heinz’s market share by expanding it to new target groups through inclusivity. To introduce the new design, the team conducted market research, studied the current problems in the existing bottle, introduced and simulated some concepts that aim to solve the existing problem. Additionally, to see if the new product is worth implementing, the product was analyzed from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The team’s main objective was to design a more inclusive and user-friendly Heinz ketchup bottle, ensuring that the solution will remain realistic from financial and production perspectives (the new design will be compatible with existing industrial production processes).</p>

    <h2>Project Goal Details</h2>

    <p>
        Our goal is to design a bottle intended for people with reduced grip strength.
        The design focuses on improving accessibility and ease of use for users who
        experience difficulty with conventional bottle and cap mechanisms.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>How the target group was identified</summary>
        <p>
            The target group of users with reduced grip strength was identified through
            an initial analysis of existing packaging and common user difficulties
            associated with bottle and cap interaction. Many current packaging designs
            require a twisting motion and a certain level of grip strength to open,
            which can present challenges for a wide range of users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Observations of existing products, combined with research into user complaints
            and accessibility issues, highlighted that opening bottles and lids is a
            frequent point of failure in inclusive packaging design. Grip based interactions
            are among the most physically demanding actions required when using everyday
            packaging, making grip strength a clear and measurable focus for the design process.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Why reduced grip strength was chosen</summary>
        <p>
            People with reduced grip strength represent a broad and relevant user group,
            including older adults, individuals with arthritis, users with temporary injuries,
            and those with conditions affecting hand mobility or muscle strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            Designing for this group addresses a common exclusion point in current packaging
            while remaining relevant to a large portion of the population. By targeting users
            with reduced grip strength, the design becomes more accessible overall. Features
            that reduce the force required to open a cap such as increased surface friction
            or mechanical advantage also improve usability for children, users with wet hands,
            or those opening the product repeatedly.

    <h2>Design Approach Details</h2>

    <p>
        The project follows the Double Diamond design approach, a widely used methodology
        in industrial design. This approach supports inclusive design by ensuring that
        problems are thoroughly explored before solutions are developed, allowing for
        informed and well considered design decisions.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Why the Double Diamond approach was chosen</summary>
        <p>
            For this project, we were tasked with designing an inclusive condiment product.
            To achieve this goal effectively, it was necessary to determine an appropriate
            design methodology. The project was approached as an industrial design project,
            making the Double Diamond method a suitable and structured framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Double Diamond approach is commonly used in industrial design engineering
            (IDE) projects because it balances exploration and refinement, ensuring that
            design decisions are based on research rather than assumptions.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How the Double Diamond was applied</summary>
        <p>
            The Double Diamond approach consists of alternating phases of divergence and
            convergence. In the first phase, a broad analysis was conducted to gather as
            much relevant information as possible. This included research into inclusive
            design principles, existing condiment packaging, and common user challenges.
            This divergent phase ensured a wide understanding of the design context.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the convergent phase, the collected information was evaluated and filtered
            to determine which insights were most relevant to the project goals. These
            insights were then used to define clear design requirements and expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the problem was clearly defined, a second divergent phase focused on
            generating a wide range of design ideas and concepts. From these concepts,
            selections were made through comparison and evaluation, ultimately leading to
            a final concept.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project concluded with refinement and validation through simulations,
            cost analysis, and physical prototyping. This ensured that the final product
            was practical, inclusive, and feasible to produce.
        </p>

  <h2>Stakeholder Analysis Details</h2>
<p>
        Stakeholder analysis was conducted to ensure that the redesign of the 220 ml Heinz
        ketchup bottle satisfies all relevant parties. Stakeholders were divided into four
        groups based on their level of interaction with the product: primary users, secondary
        users, stakeholders, and extreme users.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Primary users</summary>
        <p>
            Individuals who directly interact with the Heinz ketchup bottle daily. In Heinz’s
            case, these are consumers who buy, open, hold, and squeeze the Heinz bottle. Since
            Heinz is the largest ketchup producer in the market, this group includes adults,
            children, elderly users, and people with reduced strength and grip strength.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main issues identified are related to usability. Improving grip, accessibility,
            and ease of opening are the primary design objectives derived from the needs of this
            group.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Secondary users</summary>
        <p>
            Individuals who are in indirect contact with Heinz’s ketchup bottle, such as
            restaurant staff, household members, or warehouse and supermarket workers. They
            interact with the bottle during storage, cleaning, or meal preparation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although this group does not directly influence the design, their product
            impressions are affected by durability and ease of handling.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Stakeholders</summary>
        <p>
            Individuals who have an interest in the product but may not directly interact with
            it. Kraft Heinz is the main stakeholder as the case owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Relevant departments include R&amp;D, Packaging, Marketing, Operations, and
            Sustainability. Additional stakeholders include manufacturing partners, packaging
            suppliers, and retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This group primarily influences production constraints such as material selection
            and brand recognition.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Extreme users</summary>
        <p>
            Individuals who either use the product very frequently or rarely interact with it.
            This group is particularly valuable for identifying design limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extreme users may include individuals with reduced grip strength or arthritis.
            Their experiences help highlight key usability challenges and inform inclusive
            design decisions.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Role of stakeholder analysis</summary>
        <p>
            Stakeholder analysis helped define project priorities. While primary and extreme
            users were prioritized, Kraft Heinz as a stakeholder ensured the design remained
            feasible from both financial and production perspectives.

    <!-- USABILITY -->
    <section id="usability">
      <h1>Bottle Usability</h1>
      <p>Despite its widespread use and strong brand recognition, the 220 ml bottles have some issues that affect a positive user experience. After closely examining the bottle, the group defined some of these issues. Using the bottle requires multiple actions, especially when it is just bought. First, the customer needs to screw out the cap and then take off the peel. These actions are the hardest ones to do. For the next usage, the customer needs to open the lid and squeeze the bottle. Opening the lid can be difficult due to the size of the bottle, and squeezing it becomes harder when the amount of ketchup is decreasing. The current bottle design requires several two handed operations and provides a small surface area for grip, which reduces control while further dispensing. All these issues were closely examined by the group to come to a feasible solution that will increase the inclusivity of the 220ml ketchup bottle. </p>

      <!-- Details -->
      
      <div id="cap-turn-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Turning the Cap Details</h2>
        <p>The initial step after buying the product requires the user to unscrew the cap from the bottle to remove the peel. When the bottle is new and the cap is tightly sealed it requires additional strength. Usually to make this operation the user needs to hold the bottle with one hand and unscrew the cap with another. This makes it a two-handed operation that can require additional grip strength. Although it is a one-time operation it can affect the overall user experience especially for the people with joint pain, limited wrist mobility and reduced grip strength.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="opening-cap-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Opening Cap Details</h2>
        <p>After opening the bottle, the user is required to open the top-flip lid to use the ketchup. The smaller the lid is the more finger force it requires to open it. For the 220 ml bottle, where the leverage area is the smallest, some people might want to use the second finger, but there is not enough space for it. Mentioning the people with reduced strength, for them it becomes the most annoying challenge to try so hard to flip the lid before every use. What makes this problem even less inclusive is that you cannot leave the lid open, because the dried ketchup will build up near the dispensing point and cause a hard time for the user to get the next ketchup out. This issue was identified as the most important and of the highest priority for the team to solve with the developed concept.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="shape-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Bottle Shape Details</h2>
        <p>The bottle shape affects the squeezing force needed to dispense the ketchup. It does not matter that much when the bottle is full, but as the amount of ketchup is decreasing it starts becoming an issue. The observations and handling tests identified that the average force needed to squeeze the bottle requires 15-20N depending on the volume left. For some users it can be a solution to use both hands, but with a small contact surface the bottle might slip or the dispensing will not be very accurate.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="peel-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Peel/Seal Details</h2>
        <p>For the first use the bottle requires to remove the peel. It is a one-time action, though it can be the hardest one. To remove the peel the user needs to apply some finger strength and make sure that his hands are not wet, because it will harden the process. Sometimes the peel is not fully removed from the first try, so the user has to make several attempts.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
    <section id="requirements">
      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <p>
    The product requirements are divided into four main categories to ensure the final
    design is functional, sustainable, cost effective, and safe for users.
</p>

<details>
    <summary>1. Physical Requirements</summary>
    <p>
        The physical requirements focus on usability and ergonomics. The product must be
        easy to hold and operate for users with reduced grip strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key features include ribs on the product surface to improve grip, a larger overall
        size for easier handling, and a reduced amount of force required to open the product
        and dispense ketchup. Maintaining the recognizable shape of the existing product is
        also prioritized, as requested by the company.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2. Sustainability Requirements</summary>
    <p>
        Sustainability is addressed by minimizing product waste and reducing environmental
        impact. The design must allow all ketchup to be fully extracted so that no product
        remains unused.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the materials used should be environmentally friendly and recyclable
        wherever possible, supporting responsible production and disposal.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>3. Financial Requirements</summary>
    <p>
        The product must remain financially viable for large scale production. The overall
        cost should not exceed that of the current product to ensure affordability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design must also conform to standardized volume specifications to maintain
        consistent portion sizes and compatibility with existing manufacturing and
        distribution systems.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>4. Safety Requirements</summary>
    <p>
        User safety is a critical requirement. The product must not include sharp edges
        or design elements that could cause injury during normal use.
    </p>
    <p>
        All surfaces and components should be designed to ensure safe handling throughout
        the product their lifecycle.
    </p>
  
</details>
<p>The list of priorities was designed in order to identify the main features that have to be included in a design concept. Since the scope of the case covers a lot of aspects such as usability, inclusivity, financial feasibility, and safety, it was important to transfer qualitative goals into measurable requirements. The requirements were divided in four categories mentioned above to balance user needs with production constraints. The group chose to prioritize the physical requirements, such as grip needed, opening force, and difficult dispensing. Meanwhile, some requirements were identified by the case owner, for example, maintaining a recognizable bottle shape. The requirements functioned as a decision-making baseline to generate an effective concept development system to ensure that the design proposal addresses the identified issues. </p>

      
    </section>

    <!-- CONCEPTS -->
    <section id="concepts">
      <h1>Concepts</h1>
      <p>After considering the product requirements, three possible concepts were created which would fulfill all the necessary criteria. Each concept was designed to be unique in its approach to solving the issue at hand while keeping the core topic of inclusivity in mind.</p>
      <div class="cards-grid">
        <div class="card" onclick="toggleDetail('concept1-detail')">
          <img src="images/concept1.png" alt="Concept 1" class="concept1-logo">
          <h3>Concept 1</h3>
  
        </div>
        <div class="card" onclick="toggleDetail('concept2-detail')">
          <img src="images/concept2.png" alt="Concept 2" class="concept2-logo">
          <h3>Concept 2</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card" onclick="toggleDetail('concept3-detail')">
          <img src="images/concept3.png" alt="Concept 3" class="concept3-logo">
          <h3>Concept 3</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="concept1-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Concept 1 Details</h2>
        <p>The first concept was conceived to be the most radically different from normal. The shape of the bottle was altered to better ergonomically suit the hand and offer better grip and support. Furthermore, the bottle was also made thinner to make it easier to squeeze. The lid was also heavily altered. The traditional snap open lid of the bottle was replaced with a swivel mechanism wherein the cover would simply slide over to the side of the bottle, making one handed operation much more feasible. The shape of the lid was also altered to change it from a simple cylinder to add triangular extensions to the cylinder, in a dual teardrop type shape, dramatically increasing grip and making it easy to twist open. All these changes were hyper focused on making the overall experience of using the ketchup bottle much more inclusive for the target audience, making user experience a priority over design feasibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="concept2-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Concept 2 Details</h2>
        <p>The second concept is a more subtle change to the normal design than concept 1. It utilizes minute changes to achieve the same goal to keep design feasible. The bottle shape in this design is thinner, like in concept 1 to decrease force required to squeeze the bottle. The curves are kept close to the current design. The cap is also slightly changed to ensure the bottle is usable by far more people. The opening for the snap fit mechanism is made larger, which allows for ease of operation. All these changes allow for a more realistic upheaval of the current design considering the resources it would take. However the inclusiveness of the bottle is also considerably expanded, showcasing a balance of various different priorities.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="concept3-detail" class="card-detail hidden">
        <h2>Concept 3 Details</h2>
        <p>The third and final concept was designed with simplicity in mind. The solution was flexible, adaptable and much cheaper compared to the other two alternatives. The sleeve design ensures that the cost of production remains low and as accessible as possible. Furthermore, this concept also requires less resources to adapt, as the replacement of old manufacturing facilities is not required. The sleeve dramatically increases grip and offers a proper area to squeeze, making it easier to use the bottle. However, the design does suffer from a lack of innovation and overall low impact on inclusively, unlike the other two concepts. </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- TURNING POINT -->
    <section id="turning">
      <h1>Turning Point</h1>

<p>
    This phase of the project represents a critical turning point following feedback
    received from Heinz. The feedback introduced an external, industry based perspective
    that challenged earlier assumptions and helped refine both the design direction and
    learning objectives.
</p>

<details>
    <summary>Project status before Heinz feedback</summary>
    <p>
        Prior to receiving feedback, the project focused on exploring inclusive packaging
        concepts based on user research, inclusive design principles, and internal evaluation
        methods. Multiple concepts were developed to address accessibility challenges related
        to grip strength, squeezing force, and cap usability.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Concept selection method</summary>
    <p>
        Concept selection was guided by a structured and objective approach, using a weighted decision matrix. Concepts were evaluated against clearly
        defined criteria, including accessibility and inclusivity, ease of dispensing, cost,
        sustainability, and brand fit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accessibility and inclusivity were weighted most heavily, as they represented the
        primary design objective. This method ensured that concept selection was based on
        measurable performance rather than personal preference.
    </p>
    <p>
        The outcome of this process was the selection of a wide bottle concept with a
        twist to open cap, as it provided the best balance between inclusivity,
        manufacturability, and alignment with Heinz’s brand identity.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Key insights from Heinz feedback</summary>
    <p>
        Heinz’s feedback acknowledged the inclusive intent of the designs but emphasized
        the importance of maintaining production feasibility, brand recognition, and
        simplicity. It became clear that inclusivity should be integrated within familiar
        product architectures rather than introduced through radical changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feedback reinforced the need to balance accessibility improvements with
        manufacturing constraints, sustainability considerations, and brand consistency.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Impact on project direction</summary>
    <p>
        As a result of the feedback, the project entered a new phase with refined learning

        <h2>Material Details</h2>
        <p><p><strong>Material selection</strong><br>


<p>The following section is regarding the material selection process for the chosen components. As the product is for condiment packaging, some essentials to consider are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Safety</li>
  <li>Chemical stability / resistance</li>
  <li>Impact resistance/durability</li>
  <li>Suitable for desired manufacturing process</li>
</ul>

<p>As the material will be in direct contact with the condiment for a long period, it is crucial that the chosen material is not hazardous to human health and is chemically stable under this long exposure. The resistance to chemical change should be high and there should be no chemical mixing between the material and the condiment. It is also important injection moulding is a suitable and appropriate manufacturing process to create the condiment packaging.</p>

<p>Since plastics is a broad term, it can be narrowed down to 4 sub classifications: ultra-high-performance plastics, high performance plastics, engineering plastics and commodity plastics. The most suitable subcategory of plastics from which to select a material for condiment packaging is commodity plastics which includes packaging, bottles and disposable items.</p>

<p><strong>Lid</strong></p>

<p>Since the desired manufacturing process is injection moulding, and a lid is supposed to be recyclable, the most suited polymer would be thermoplastics. During the injection moulding process, thermoplastics soften under heat treatment however solidify once cooled.</p>

<p><strong>PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate)</strong><br>
General Properties:<br>
High strength and stiffness for commodity/engineering thermoplastic. It is also practical and is recyclable. PET also has good melt flow; however, unfilled PET is not suitable for injection moulding. It also has poor heat distortion temperature and high mold shrinkage.<br>
Composition overview:<br>
PET is a semi-crystalline or amorphous thermoplastic which can be transparent or opaque. Since amorphous grades have better clarity and barrier properties, additives which lower the crystallinity are added for production of transparent parts. Unmodified grades have high elongation, meaning its more ductile. Mineral filled grades can be used to counter the warpage and shrinkage at the cost of some strength being lost.</p>

<p><strong>PP (Polypropylene)</strong><br>
General Properties:<br>
High strength and high stiffness. Also has a higher service temperature and lower density. Also provides high durability against heat, impact and chemicals. Moderately high resistance to chemicals apart from fuels and provides good environmental stress cracking resistance. Good fatigue resistance and some grades are already approved for food packaging. This polymer does not dissolve in water.<br>
Composition overview:<br>
The composition of PP is semi-crystalline, and it is a thermoplastic. This means that it is highly stiff and strong.</p>

<p><strong>PC (Polycarbonate)</strong><br>
General Properties:<br>
High usefulness for engineering offered due to its properties over a wide temperature range. Needs additional properties, especially impact resistance. Not an ideal choice as the caps needs to be impact resistance throughout the mass transportation of condiment packaging.<br>
Composition overview:<br>
PC is a tough thermoplastic which is fully amorphous. PC is manufactured from BPA which is related to estrogenic effects at high doses. This limits the usability of this polymer as it’s not exactly chemically safe for the food packaging industry.</p>

<p><strong>PE (Polyethylene)</strong><br>
General Properties:<br>
Very cheap and offers good chemical and hydrolysis resistance. Also has high impact strength as low temperatures as well. The yield strength for this polymer increases with density. Also has a high tensile strength. Lower stiffness than PP and poor UV resistance so might not be a suitable choice for open transportation. The temperature for operating and heat distortion are quite low.<br>
Composition overview:<br>
This polymer is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic which is very good for injection moulding. This polymer is also chemically safe. However, due to low density, the polymer is somewhat ductile, making it harder for precise machining.</p>

<p>Table 2 – Material selection matrix for the lid</p>

<p>Based on the results from the selection matrix, considering the weighing factors and how well the different polymers perform for that specific material property, PP is the most suitable and appropriate material choice for the cap of the condiment packaging.</p>

<p>Polypropylene (PP) is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic. It is widely used in the packaging industry especially in food packaging as well for caps and lids due to its good resistance to chemical changes. It is also relatively sustainable as well as a cheap option good for mass production. Some of the main strengths of using PP over the other 3 polymers include good toughness durability and resistance to elongations and the fact that injection moulding is highly compatible due to the stable flow characteristics [<a href="https://www.chinaplasticsbottles.com/info/why-is-pp-more-suitable-for-bottle-caps-103050197.html" target="_blank">chinaplasticbottles</a>
, accessed 13/01/26]</p>

<p>Considering that the design has a snap fit, it’s crucial that the material does not fracture due to being too brittle but is also strong enough to withstand high stresses without permanently deforming. For a snap fit, the part should bend elastically and reaches failure only when the elastic strain is exceeded. Hence to choose the correct composition of the chosen material, a performance index is used. The performance index favours polymers with a high yield strength and a low flexural modulus.<br>
Performance index: σ_y/E_f<br>
Since the general polymer is chosen to be PP, the different compositions of PP will be plotted according to the chosen performance index to provide the best possible compositions.</p>

  </a>
  <br>
  Fig 1 – Performance index graphed for most suitable material compositions
</p>



<p>The results after plotting the different compositions yielded that the top 3 materials to be:<br>
PP (copolymer, 10% talc)<br>
PP (homopolymer, 10% calcium carbonate)<br>
PP (homopolymer, 10% talc)</p>

<p><strong>Homopolymer vs. copolymer</strong><br>
Homopolymer refers to the structure consisting of only monomers, in this case monomers of propylene. Due to this, the chains are linear and regular, which ensures high crystallinity of the material. It also has good chemical resistance however could be brittle in low temperature conditions.<br>
Copolymer refers to the structure consisting of firstly propylene monomers along with another monomer which is usually ethylene. Copolymer has higher impact strength and flexibility. Copolymers also generally tend to not become brittle in low temperatures.<br>
However, since the cap is designed to resist any leakages of condiment, and more importantly withstand the forces experienced on the threading, homopolymer is a more suitable choice. During crystallisation, chains are packed densely which reduce the volume. Crystalline polymers are also more susceptible to shrinkage and in extreme cases warpage or distortion due to high non uniform shrinkages. A lid must not deform too much but rather allow the desired deformation without experiencing any cracking. Between linear and branched molecular structures, a linear structure is preferred due to the high stiffness it offers. Branched polymers provide flexibility.<br>
The 10% talc filled enhances the stiffness of the polymer as well as dimensional stability making it even more suitable especially for the forces the threads experience. However, the stiffness decreases due to the filling but it’s not drastic, making this material still a suitable and appropriate material choice for the cap of the condiment packaging.<br>
The chosen material is PP (homopolymer, 10% talc). The technical data sheet is linked below.<br>

<p>Table 3 – Weighing factors for the preform/bottle</p>
<p>Table 4 – Material selection matrix for the preform/bottle</p>

<p>The results of the selection matrix deem that PP is the most suitable for a bottle, however PET is close second only behind by 1 point. The score given for PP for density and price is the reason why it outperforms PET in the selection matrix. Since the bottle needs to be opaque as well as be sustainable, PET can be chosen over PP as it essentially provides the same performance. Also, PET is suitable for both injection moulding as well as blow moulding. Since the preform is injection moulded and then later needs to be blow moulded, this makes PET a good choice for the bottle/preform.</p>

<p>The material choice from Granta after plotting PET compositions for the chosen material index provided the top pick to be: PET (unfilled, semi crystalline)</p>

<p>Semi crystalline means that both, ordered crystalline and disordered amorphous structures can be found in the molecular structure of the polymer. This chosen material can also be translucent/opaque which is a norm in the condiment packaging industry. Unreinforced means that it consists of only monomers and are linear which achieves good stiffness and means that the polymer is strong. This polymer is also slightly more ductile than PP homopolymer 10% talc which was chosen for the lid. This means that its easier for the condiment to be extracted from the bottle.</p>

<p>The chosen material is Ertalyte PET unreinforced, semi-crystalline. The technical data sheet is provided. Data sheet: <a href="https://laminatedplastics.com/ertalyte.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

    <strong>Underpinning design decisions:</strong><br><br>

    The three main modifications to the lid below are reasoning for the new design dicisions
    in the chosen final design.
</p>

<details>
    <summary>
        Lid Inner Thread (<a href="#fig-thread">figure</a>)
    </summary>

    <p>
        The inner thread of a current ketchup bottle designhas multiple loops, which means
        the lid needs to be twisted multiple revolutions to completely screw/unscrew the cap.
        This was the motivation behind the final design that was chosen, which contains around
        1 revolution of thread meaning that less twisting revolutions are required in the end
        to screw and unscrew the lid from the other portion of the bottle.
    </p>

    <figure id="fig-thread">
        <img src="images/base-zwivel.png" alt="Lid inner thread comparison">
        <figcaption>Lid inner thread modification</figcaption>
    </figure>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Slotted Swivel Mechanism (<a href="#fig-swivel">figure</a>)
    </summary>

    <p>
        The conventional mechanism to open the ketchup bottle that needs to be pushed up and
        down typically requires a lot of force applied on a small ‘wedge’, this is especially
        a challenge to those with health conditions, for example Arthritis.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is why this was also a point of attention in the re-design: instead of an
        up-down-hinge based mechanism, this new design is a swivel mechanism, which means that
        to open and close the lid only a swivel motion has to be made, this is a relatively
        easier motion to make that can be implemented relatively easily into a re-design as
        well without adding extra undercuts or manufacturing complications.
    </p>

    <figure id="fig-swivel">
        <img src="images/base-realzwivle.png" alt="Slotted swivel mechanism">

</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Protrusion either side (<a href="#fig-lid">figure</a>)
    </summary>

    <p>
        Finally, it was noted that in the typical design of the lid of a ketchup bottle, there
        is purely an outer cylindrical profile. This notably, is not very easy to grip since
        it is a smooth and rounded surface.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond the context of limited mobility, this is also justified by other real-world use
        factors such as oily hands, which all add to the difficulty of twisting motion.
    </p>

    <p>
        This forms another key point in the re-design of the lid-based mechanism: protrusions
        in triangular shapes, that are 180 degrees apart from each other, which help form a
        better ‘grip’ based structure relative to a purely cylindrical, circular outer profile,
        that is typically seen in the lids from such condiment bottles.

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>
      Compared to the original plastic bottle shape, the shape was chosen to be that of Concept 1. Notably, the width has been reduced to make the gripping motion relatively less slippery. Furthermore, there is also a ‘V-shape’ section towards the lower end of the bottle  (the cap end) to make the bottle still follow the rather classical taper-based shape of Heinz, and to stop the bottle from slipping more when it is being held. The ‘V-shape’ in particular contributes to having a better placement of the thumb when holding the bottle (compared to other, more traditional exams), see thumb placement in Concept 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from the changes made in the lid mechanism (discussed above), these changes were also implemented to the bottle to improve usability for those groups of individuals with limited mobility.

        <h2>Simulation Details</h2>
        <details>
  <summary>Injection Molding Overview</summary>
  <p>
    The clamping force for both the base and the lid components ranges between 3 and 6 tons, which is very similar. Therefore, the same injection molding machine can be used for both parts. An all-electric injection molding machine is recommended for this operation, as it provides high precision, low energy consumption, clean operation, and excellent repeatability. This makes it especially suitable for molding small polypropylene (PP) components, such as cups or bottle parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both components exhibit minimal weld lines, which is ideal. Maximum deflection is low, around 1 mm, almost the same deflection in areas where the parts need to fit together. This ensures that assembly is straightforward and functional. Additionally, the injection pressure is uniform across both components, indicating a balanced and well optimized molding process.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Base Analysis</summary>
  <p>
    The base uses two gates, which was found to be the most optimized configuration for achieving uniform filling. Cooling channels have been placed on the sides; however, this placement does not effectively cool the inner front portion, resulting in a temperature difference of more than 10°C. To further optimize cooling, additional channels could be added to the top and bottom of the base. A baffle could also be introduced inside the front section where the temperature is highest, helping to achieve more uniform cooling throughout the part.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Lid Analysis</summary>
  <p>
    The lid is designed with a single gate positioned near the middle, which provides the most optimized filling pattern. Currently, the upper part of the runner solidifies faster than the lower part because the cooling channels are closer to the upper side. To improve this, the cooling channels could either be repositioned on the sides of the part or the distance between the two upper channels could be increased. This would allow the runner to solidify more slowly and improve overall part quality.

        <h2>Cost Analysis Details</h2>

<p>
    The cost analysis compares the chosen concept against the baseline Heinz ketchup bottle
    using a comparative cost benefit analysis (CBA). All calculations are based on publicly
    available data and clearly stated assumptions.
</p>

<details>
    <summary>General confidentiality & scope</summary>
    <p>
        Quantity and price assumptions were made to analyze the new design from the cost
        perspective against the baseline (current bottle). All calculations are made based
        on assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data used is taken from public sources and assumptions. Therefore, this CBA uses
        a comparative approach (baseline against chosen design).

    <summary>Product and assumptions</summary>
    <p>
        The product: 220 ml Heinz ketchup bottle
    </p>
    <p>
        Assumptions:
        <br>Processing electricity cost (kWh/€)
        <br>EPR (extended producer responsibility (€/kg)) : paying for collection, sorting,
        and packaging treatment
        <br>Upfront tooling modification
        <br>Material cost and amount for bottle (PET) and cap (PP)
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is excluded</summary>
    <p>
        Transportation cost: the new design will align with the existing “bottle family,”
        meaning no changes will be made to secondary packaging, palletization, or truckloads.
        If future measurement indicates a decreased density, it should be considered a
        sensitivity risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Filling, labor, logistics, and retail pricing remain unchanged.

    <summary>Conclusion and feasibility</summary>
    <p>
        The total difference in price between designs is 0.010571 €/bottle. Multiplied by the
        total amount of bottles produced, the additional cost per year to produce the new
        design will be 1,057,100 €.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the production of the new bottle can be considered feasible if adjusted
        with production quantity and the benefit of expanding the market, taking inclusiveness
        into account.

    <section id="reflection">
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>The unique setup of the project given came with its own set of challenges and triumphs. In this part of the project there is going to be reflected on which choices there have been made and what could have been done better. The goal of this is to learn from mistakes made along the way and sometimes see if there can be come up with a better solution. In this part the first thing that is going to be explained is what mistakes have been made. Then there will be gone over what our new solution would be and lastly there will be explained why this solution would be better. </p>
      <p>Starting the project one of the first big challenges was figuring out what everyone’s job would be in the project and how everything would be structured. This meant that there was quite a lot of time lost in the beginning of the project, because there was no certainty yet if what was being done was actually the right thing to do. The analysis and ideation phase of the project was cut short because of this. This meant that the final concept we developed was not ideal and did not fit all the requirements.  

The biggest problem that needed to be solved in the ideation phase is that to open the bottle and get ketchup out the bottle had to be screwed open and a plastic seal had to be removed. These two motions are hard to do for people with reduced grip strength. Our initial solution was to make the cap bigger and more oblong so that the bottle could be screwed open. In addition to this we decided to make the seal bigger so that people can hold onto it better and get it off quicker. Even though these things help the user open the bottle easier, they still have to do the hard motion which is not ideal.  </p>
